This week's homework mainly focuses on creating functions on javascript to generate random password by taking .js starter code provided and add some functions with utilizing for loop, while loop, if statement, and math functions. 

Achievements:
Prompts for password criteria are displayed once generate password button is clicked which includes choosing password length, whether to include lower case, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. Prompt to enter password length will appear if length specified is not 8-128 or isn't a numeric value. Once criterias are chosen, a confirmation prompt will be generated. If criterias are not confirmed or if none of the criterias are selected, prompts for criterias will re-appear. Password will contain at least one character type selected and will be displayed on the page.
